# Comparisons: assert2

https://crates.io/crates/assert2

From the docs: All-purpose assert!(...) and check!(...) macros, inspired by Catch2. There is also a debug_assert!(...) macro that is disabled on optimized builds by default. As cherry on top there is a let_assert!(...) macro that lets you test a pattern while capturing parts of it.
