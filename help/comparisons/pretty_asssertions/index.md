# Comparisons: pretty_assertions

The `pretty_assertions` Rust crate focuses on color highlighting of assertion failure messages that are displayed in a developer's terminal. This helps a developer visually eyeball where data is inequal. This is akin to a visual diff tool.

Assertables doesn't offer this yet. We have this as a feature request from multiple users, and we're hoping to find an open source developer volunteer who would like to work on this feature.
